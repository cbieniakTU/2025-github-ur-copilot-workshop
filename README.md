# GitHub Copilot Workshop

This is the work repository for Github Copilot Workshop in Github Universe Recap 2025, Jakarta, Indonesia.

## About

We are going to create Pomodoro web application using Python, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Getting started with `uv` and `venv`

### uv

Install `uv` if you don't have it in your system yet. `uv` is a modern, high-performance Python package manager and installer written in Rust. It serves as a drop-in replacement for traditional Python package management tools like pip, offering significant improvements in speed, reliability, and dependency resolution.. Go to this file to install `uv`: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/.

### venv
Install `venv` to create a virtual environment for this work project:
```bash
# install venv
uv venv
```

Activate `venv`:
```bash
# activate venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```
